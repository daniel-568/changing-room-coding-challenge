A to-do list that sorts tasks by deadlines (for simplicity's sake - dated by month-day agnostic to the year and hour/minutes/seconds).

### Setup

Activate it (Linux)

```console
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Install Requirements

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app

```console
$ flask run
```

Users are able to create new tasks with title and deadline, mark them as complete or incomplete, and to delete them as well.

Data is stored through SQLAlchemy and SQLite database.
